All manager classes inherit from DataManager, that ensure everything is persistent to JSON file through the _save_data() method.
/data for JSON files including config
Each entity has its own JSON file



Each class registers its specific entity type eg "user" "city"
Methods for interaction (get, save, update, delete) follow a similar pattern using methods from DataManager
Data persistence is handled by the DataManager class, ensuring consistency and avoiding code repetition.

To do:
More error handling -> data validation for example.
Additional functionnalities specific to their entities like filtering cities by country in the CountriesManager.
